# GromovWitten

Documentation for [GromovWitten](https://github.com/singular-gpispace/GromovWitten).

The package GromovWitten computes generating series for tropical Hurwitz numbers of elliptic curves via mirror symmetry and Feynman integrals, and thus, by a correspondence theorem, Hurwitz numbers in the sense algebraic geometry. Generalizations of the method also allow for the computation of Gromov-Witten invariants for ellptic curves, and are also implemented in the package. GromovWitten is based on the computeralgebra system [OSCAR](https://docs.oscar-system.org/stable/) and is provided as a package for the Julia programming language.
